In-place algorithms:

An in-place algorithm transforms the input without using any extra memory. As the algorithm executes, the input is usually overwritten by the output, and no additional space is needed for this operation.
An in-place algorithm may require a small amount of extra memory for its operation. However, the amount of memory required must not be dependent on the input size and should be constant.
Several sorting algorithms rearrange the input into sorted order in-place, such as insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, bubble sort, heap sort, etc. All these algorithms require a constant amount of extra space for rearranging the elements in the input array.
Usually, an algorithm is categorized as an in-place or an out-of-place algorithm based on the explicit storage allocated by the algorithm. However, calling a recursive algorithm as in-place is highly debatable since extra space is being used by the call stack. Although this space required by the call stack technically takes the recursive algorithms out of the in-place algorithms category, the algorithms requiring only O(log(n)) additional space is considered to be in-place.
In-place algorithms are usually used in an embedded system that runs in limited memory. They reduce the space requirements to a great extent, but the algorithm time complexity increases in some cases.

Out-of-place algorithms:

An algorithm that is not in-place is called a not-in-place or out-of-place algorithm. Unlike an in-place algorithm, the extra space used by an out-of-place algorithm depends on the input size.
The standard merge sort algorithm is an example of out-of-place algorithm as it requires O(n) extra space for merging. The merging can be done in-place, but it increases the time complexity of the sorting routine.

ANS[3]:
In-place techniques have lesser space complexity but are difficult to 
apply in algorithm whereas out-place techniques are easy to apply but 
increases the space complexity of algorithm.
For example if we want to reverse an array then its in-place algorithm
will be swaping the first and last element of array until we reach the 
middle of array,If we want to solve the same problem using out-place 
algorithm we have to create one extra array of same size and copy 
elements of original array from back to the front of new array,this 
algorithm increases the space complexity to O(n) as we have created an 
extra array.
IN-PLACE algorithm are used in Bubble sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Heapsort.

OUT-Of-Place algorithm is used in Merge Sort, Because merge sort requires O(n) extra space.
